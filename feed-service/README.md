## Local Setup

### In docker

Docker-compose is used for deployment

1. Create an environment variables file in the root directory
```text
./.env
```

2. Change environment variables if you need
3. Build the local service image
```text
make build-image
```
4. Run the project using Docker Compose
```text
make deploy
```
5. Check containers
```text
docker ps
```
6. You can use the [postman collection](postman) or cURL below to test API methods 
```text
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8084/api/feed/v1/news?limit=5'

curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8084/api/feed/v1/news?limit=5&cursor=2023-08-16T08:00:00Z'

curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8084/api/feed/v1/news/64dcc2326c1e91ddcad83046'
```
7. You can watch docker logs in real time
```text
docker logs -f feed-service
```
8. You can remove services after testing
```text
make delete
```

### Locally

1. You can create you own configuration file and specify it in environment variables
```text
cp ./config/default.yaml ./config/local.yaml

CONFIG_FILE=./config/local.yaml
```
2. Run external services like db, broker, cache etc. using docker compose file
```text
make deploy services='mongodb'
```
3. It is ready, you can run this application, for example, via IntelliJ IDEA.

## Testing
- You can run unit tests using cmd ```make test-unit```
